# Using this files you can set the parameters of the function used to make the sequence to form the fractal. Order of parameters:
# 
# Type of equation -> Julia/Mandelbrot
# Exponent of the equation
# Real part of the constant C      (only used if type = Julia)
# Imaginary part of the constant C (only used if type = Julia)
#
# Example of Mandelbrot type of exponent 3:
# 
# Mandelbrot
# 3
#
# Example of Julia set for C = -0.4 + 0.6i, and exponent 2
#
# Julia
# 2
# -0.4
# 0.6
#
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# Leave blank for usual fractal (Mandelbrot, power = 2)
